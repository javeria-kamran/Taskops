# Implementation Plan: Phase I Console Todo Application

**Branch**: `001-phase1-console-app` | **Date**: December 27, 2025 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-phase1-console-app/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Build an in-memory Python console application providing 5 Basic Level todo operations (Create, View, Update, Delete, Mark Complete) through a command-line menu interface. The application will store tasks in-memory with no persistence, following spec-driven development using Claude Code and Spec-Kit Plus. All code must be generated from specifications with >80% test coverage and clean architecture principles.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Python 3.13+
**Primary Dependencies**: UV (package manager), pytest (testing framework), standard Python libraries only
**Storage**: In-memory data structures (no external database or file persistence)
**Testing**: pytest with >80% code coverage requirement
**Target Platform**: Cross-platform console/terminal (Windows, Linux, macOS)
**Project Type**: Single project (console application)
**Performance Goals**:
- Application startup to main menu: <2 seconds
- Task list view (100 tasks): <1 second
- Task creation: <30 seconds (including user input time)
- Menu navigation: <5 seconds between options

**Constraints**:
- In-memory storage only (data lost on exit)
- No external dependencies for core functionality
- >80% unit test coverage
- All code generated by Claude Code from specifications
- Clean code principles and proper project structure

**Scale/Scope**:
- Single-user console application
- 5 Basic Level operations only (Phase I scope)
- Support for 100+ tasks without performance degradation
- Title max 200 chars, description max 1000 chars

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### Principle 1: Spec-Driven Development First
- [x] Feature spec exists in `/specs/001-phase1-console-app/`
- [x] Spec includes user stories and acceptance criteria (5 user stories, all with Given-When-Then scenarios)
- [x] Technical implementation details are documented in spec
- [x] Spec reviewed and approved before implementation (quality checklist passed)
- [ ] Implementation matches spec exactly (pending - will verify during Phase 2 tasks)

**Status**: ✅ PASS - Spec complete and validated

### Principle 2: Agentic Development Workflow
- [x] Step 1 (Specify) - Complete, spec.md created
- [x] Step 2 (Plan) - In progress, this plan.md file
- [ ] Step 3 (Task Breakdown) - Pending (Phase 2, /speckit.tasks command)
- [ ] Step 4 (Implement) - Pending (Phase 3, /speckit.implement command)
- [ ] Step 5 (Validate) - Pending (Phase 4, testing against acceptance criteria)

**Status**: ✅ PASS - Following workflow correctly

### Principle 3: Progressive Enhancement
- [x] Building Phase I foundation only
- [x] Basic Level features only (5 operations: Add, View, Update, Delete, Mark Complete)
- [x] No Phase II features (no persistence, no web interface, no API, no auth)
- [x] No Intermediate/Advanced features (no priorities, tags, search, filtering, sorting, due dates, recurring tasks)

**Status**: ✅ PASS - Scope correctly bounded to Phase I

### Principle 4: Clean Architecture & Separation of Concerns
- [x] Single project structure appropriate for console app
- [x] Clear separation: models/ (Task entity), services/ (business logic), cli/ (user interface), lib/ (utilities)
- [x] Layered approach: CLI → Services → Models
- [x] No cross-layer violations planned

**Status**: ✅ PASS - Clean architecture planned

### Principle 11: Quality & Testing Standards
- [x] >80% test coverage required (FR-019, SC-007)
- [x] Unit tests for all business logic
- [x] pytest as testing framework
- [x] Console input/output validation tests planned

**Status**: ✅ PASS - Testing standards met

### Principle 12: Documentation & Knowledge Sharing
- [x] README.md required for project overview and setup
- [x] Spec documentation complete
- [x] Self-documenting code required (clear naming)
- [x] Comments only where logic is non-obvious

**Status**: ✅ PASS - Documentation standards clear

### Principles 5-10: Not Applicable for Phase I
- **Principle 5 (Security)**: N/A - No authentication/authorization in Phase I console app
- **Principle 6 (Stateless)**: N/A - Phase II+ requirement (web services)
- **Principle 7 (Database)**: N/A - Phase II+ requirement (persistence)
- **Principle 8 (AI Agent)**: N/A - Phase III requirement (MCP tools and chatbot)
- **Principle 9 (Cloud-Native)**: N/A - Phase IV/V requirement (containers and K8s)
- **Principle 10 (Event-Driven)**: N/A - Phase V requirement (Kafka, Dapr)

**Overall Status**: ✅ PASS - All applicable constitutional principles satisfied

```

**Structure Decision**: Selected **Option 1 (Single Project)** because Phase I is a standalone console application with no web/mobile components. The structure provides clear separation of concerns:

- **models/**: Pure data entities with validation logic (Task class)
- **services/**: Business logic layer (TaskManager for CRUD operations)
- **cli/**: User interface layer (menu system and I/O handlers)
- **lib/**: Shared utilities (validators, formatters)
- **tests/**: Comprehensive test coverage organized by type (unit, integration)

This structure supports clean architecture with clear dependencies flowing from CLI → Services → Models, making it easy to test each layer independently and ensuring >80% coverage requirement is achievable.

## Complexity Tracking

> **No violations to track** - All constitutional principles are satisfied for Phase I scope.
